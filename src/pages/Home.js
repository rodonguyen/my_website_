            I’m a motivated machine learning engineer who loves to create
            data-driven, AI-integrated products that bring value to users at
            scale. Equipped with a diverse skill set, from software development,
            data analysis to deep learning model design, I’m excited to take on
            new challenges.

            Around age 8, I had the chance to play around with computer (which
            is very lucky of me) and never stopped since. I loved the Iron Man
            movies so much that I decided to pursue Artificial Inteligence to
            make a J.A.R.V.I.S for my own. And yes, to this date I'm still
            working on things closely relating to Artificial Intelligence and
            Machine Learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            During my free time, I like to build pet projects where I put my
            skills or my recently acquired knowledge to practice. Don't forget
            to pay a visit to my{" "}
            {createHyperlink("https://github.com/rodonguyen", "GitHub")}
            :)
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides doing hands-on work, I'm also a future-focus person who pays
            attention to the long-term plan. I have a strong analytical thinking
            mentality from working in research environments (QUT and CSIRO).
